what we accomplished yesterday, what we're going to do today, any roadblocks?

YESTERDAY:
we wrote a simple web page
we created github accounts
we created a code repository on github
we installed the git software on our computers
we cloned our repository to a local workspace on our computers
and then we broke git with that email thing...

TODAY:
we're going to fix the git email thing
we're going to sync our local workspace with our github repository
we're going to add an extension to VSCode to make it easier to build our webpage
we're going to add some standard html elements to our webpage
we're going to add some styling to our webpage
we're going to create a new webpage using Bootstrap
